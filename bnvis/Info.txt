This visualization is divided into two parts.<br><br>
On the left-hand side you can see the Baysian Net, consisting of rectangular fields in different colors, which stand for different types of concepts. You can find these types of concepts: Symptom (yellow), Diagnosis (red), Examination (blue) and Therapy (green). (You can adjust the kind of types in a later version of this system.) <br><br>
The fields are connected with arrows, which represent the dependence between them.<br><br>
On each field you can see the belonging states and the prior propabilities, which are shown in the pie chart.<br><br>
You can set an observation (the observated state's probability becomes 1) by marking the corresponding button on the left. Then every dependent probability will be updated.<br><br>
On the right-hand side you can see some more details of one field/concept by clicking on it. You can see a table containing the conditional propabilities, depending on the parents of this concept. <br><br>
